### people who cant find anything usefull on the internet

So I am trying to figure out how to build a Twitch extension, however I have pretty much no web-programming experience.
Things I know:  
							* Java	  	  
              * some JavaScript  
              * how to fake to know thing  

**Follow along my journey to the unknown lands of Twitch full stack developement** (but not really full stack, because in this application I really do not want to have to host a server.)
